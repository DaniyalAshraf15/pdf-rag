# AI-Powered PDF Processing & Semantic Search

This project provides a web-based solution for uploading PDF documents, generating vector embeddings, and performing semantic search using OpenAIâ€™s language models. It efficiently extracts text from PDFs, converts them into vector embeddings, stores them in Pinecone, and enables users to retrieve relevant information using natural language queries.

## Features

- **PDF Upload & Processing**: Users can upload PDFs through a web interface.
- **Text Extraction & Chunking**: Extracts text and splits it into smaller chunks using LangChain for better context retention.
- **Vector Embeddings Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to create embeddings.
- **Efficient Storage**: Stores embeddings in Pinecone for fast and scalable retrieval.
- **Semantic Search & Query Handling**: Queries are transformed into embeddings and matched against stored vectors to fetch the most relevant context.
- **AI-Powered Response Generation**: OpenAI's language models generate refined answers based on retrieved content.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables
Set up API keys and host details:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
export PINECONE_API_KEY='your-pinecone-api-key'
export PINECONE_HOST='your-pinecone-host'
```

## Usage

1. **Start the application**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Access the application**
   - **Local:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
   - **Remote:** `http://your-vm-ip:5000/` (Ensure port 5000 is open in the firewall)
3. **Upload a PDF** through the web interface.
4. **Process the file** to generate embeddings.
5. **Enter a query** and select an OpenAI model.
6. **Retrieve relevant search results** and AI-generated responses.
7. **End the session** to clean up stored data.
